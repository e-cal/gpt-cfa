# Before answering, you should think through the question step-by-step.
# Explain your reasoning at each step towards answering the question.
# If calculation is required, do each step of the calculation as a step in your reasoning.

# Question:
# Phil Jones, CFA, has just finished researching Alpha One Inc. and is about to issue an unfavorable report on the company. His manager does not want him to state any adverse opinions about Alpha One, as it could adversely affect their firm’s relations with the company, which is an important investment banking client. Which of the following actions by the manager most likely violates Standard I (B): Independence and Objectivity?

# A. Putting Alpha One on a restricted list
# B. Asking Jones to issue a favorable report
# C. Asking Jones to only state facts about the company

# Thinking:
#     - The CFA Institute's Standard I (B): Independence and Objectivity states that a CFA charterholder or candidate must use reasonable care and judgment to achieve and maintain independence and objectivity in their professional activities. They must not offer, solicit, or accept any gift, benefit, compensation, or consideration that reasonably could be expected to compromise their own or another’s independence and objectivity.
#     - In this case, the manager is trying to influence Phil's research report on Alpha One Inc. due to the company's relationship with their firm. This is a clear attempt to compromise Phil's independence and objectivity in his professional activities.
#     - Therefore, the manager's action of trying to prevent Phil from issuing an unfavorable report on Alpha One Inc. most likely violates Standard I (B): Independence and Objectivity.
